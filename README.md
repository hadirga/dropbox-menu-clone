The starting project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it has all the available scripts, so you can run:

- `npm install` to install the nodejs dependencies.
- `npm start` to start the development mode preview [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
